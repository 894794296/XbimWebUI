We only use very few methods from glMatrix library so it might be a good idea
for the future to implement only these few functions in typescript. Using module loading
we should only end up with what we actually need. 

This is currently work-in-progress. These typescript files are not referenced.

All files in this folder are just a typescript refactoring of gl-matrix library
created by Brandon Jones, Colin MacKenzie IV. The original license applies to this code.
